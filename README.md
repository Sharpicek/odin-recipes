# Project: Recipes
This is my first Odin Project!

Here I will show you my HTML skillz, and also Git and GitHub. I even did everything using CLI. At least I hope so :D

Done!
I managed to use mostly CLI! Which was the hardest part for me, I'm not used to it.

Well now its finished with the addition of 'go to parent' links.

PS: I don't have an index.html, insted I named it odin-recipes.html because index.html is in the root folder, which is like a homepage for my Odin projects.

So after the [06-cascade-fix](../css-exercises/foundations/06-cascade-fix/) exercise, I added CSS to Odin Recipes. I kinda tried to make it look more eye pleasing. 

The Block and Inline lesson made me work on my CSS styles and I have to say that now it looks way better. But it still sucks ass. Hopefully this was the last time I worked on the recipes project :D
