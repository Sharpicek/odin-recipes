    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. 
        It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="butter-chicken">
        <li>2 tbsp peanut oil</li>

    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saut√© shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. 
            Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.</li>
        <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. 
            Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken (cut it into bite-size pieces) until lightly browned, 
            about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has 
            reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.</li>
        <li>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice with naan.</li>
